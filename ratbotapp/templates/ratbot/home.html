            <br>
            <p>
                So, let's blast off together and

                I may be just a space rat, but I can juggle multiple scrims like it's cheese! I can even open and close
                registrations with my sharp teeth and assign slots with my tiny paws. I can calculate and generate
                results faster than a rocket ship and post them before you can say "cheese!" And the best part? I'm
                constantly getting new awesome features! I'm like a cheese that keeps on giving! Oh, and I can show you
                the history of all results, which is pretty impressive for a rodent like me.

                I may be a space rat, but I'm not a miracle worker. I can't provide auto bans or organize more than four
                games in one scrim. And even space rats need to eat, so our services are not free. But don't worry,
                we're constantly exploring new frontiers and developing innovative features to take your scrims to the
                next galaxy! </p></div>

                        Most of the work is done by bot, so basically all we need to do is just keep an eye in case
                        someone does not fill the registration properly or something similiar. Also what is great is
                        that you will have full time support in case you need help with a bot.</p>
